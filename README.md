# Unity-UnityCar

Just some very minor edits to the existing CarControl.cs script in: Unity 6 docs - "Car with wheel colliders tutorial" simply for things like adding pub struct to list so as to combine the CarControl and Wheels files into one just for example and then to provide scripts variants for both old and new input and provide variants of such for Unity 6 and also 2021-22


Original Unity Tutorial: "Create a car with Wheel colliders": https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/WheelColliderTutorial.html 

Note: (This repository directory here as noted above in the description is merely some files from such tutorial mildly edited)
