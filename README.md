# Unity-UnityCar
Just some very minor edits to the existing CarControl.cs script in: Unity 6 docs - "Car with wheel colliders tutorial" simply for things like adding pub struct to list so as to combine the CarControl and Wheels files into one just for example and then to provide scripts variants for both old and new input and provide variants of such for Unity 6 and also 2021-22

NOTE: Due to the files the CarControl script and Wheels script now being combined as one instead obviosly the setup instructions are slightly different due to such and while such should be self explanatory if you are familar with the tutorial, regardless, I will write some setup instructions soon as my free time may allow just in case there are any confusions with setup using the changes in these mildly edited variants
